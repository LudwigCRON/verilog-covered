    <title>Specifying metric weights</title>
    <para>
    The rank command has several options that allow the user to weight any and all of the coverage metrics that Covered 
    supplies.  Weights are used to ascribe the importance of its metric in ranking the value of a CDD file.
    </para>
    <para>
    Weight values are non-negative numbers whose values are relative to each other.  A value of 0 effectively disables 
    the associated weight from consideration in ranking.  All other values are considered relative to each other.  In
    other words, if the line weight is set to a value of 5 while the toggle weight is set to 1, line coverage is 
    considered 5 times more important than toggle coverage in ranking.
    </para>
    <para>
    By default, each metric is given an equal weight of 1.  Adjust each of the metrics as necessary to potentially
    modify which CDD files are chosen and what order those CDD files are given in the ranked list of diagnostics to run.

    <title>Description of ranking algorithm</title>
    <para>
    This section describes the overall algorithm that is used to rank the specified CDD files. The algorithm is being 
    presented in this document for the purposes of providing an explanation for how diagnostics are selected for
    ranking and how they are ranked. Knowing this information is not necessary for using the rank command or 
    understanding its results.
    </para>
    <para>
    The algorithm makes use of three different types of structures.  The first structure is a bit-compressed structure
    where each bit corresponds to one coverage point in the associated CDD file. The purpose of this structure is to 
    store a large amount of information as concisely and immediately available as possible. In addition to coverage
    point information, each structure also contains the following information:
    </para>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
          Name of CDD file that the structure is associated with (for reporting purposes only).
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
          The number of timesteps that occurred during the CDD simulation. This is used for calculating the average 
          number of coverage points hit during a single clock period -- used for ranking selection.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
          The total number of coverage points hit by the CDD. This is used for calculating the average number of 
          coverage points hit during a single clock period -- used for ranking selection.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
          The total number of coverage points that were hit by this CDD that were not hit by any other CDD listed in
          the rank command-line. This information is used to figure out which CDDs are absolutely necessary to be
          included in the ranked list.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
          The current score associated with the CDD file. This value is updated for each selection iteration.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
    Each of these structures are maintained in an array that is iterated on during the ranking process.
    </para>
    <para>
    The second structure is an array of 16-bit values where each value corresponds to a single coverage point. Its 
    value is a sum of the number of unranked CDD files that have hit that coverage point. Each value is decremented
    by one when a CDD file is moved from the unranked list to the ranked list and that CDD file hits the given
    coverage point. If a coverage point value is a value of 1 and a CDD file has its corresponding coverage bit set,
    we know that the CDD is the only one that hits the coverage point.
    </para>
    <para>
    The third structure is similar to the second and works similarly, except that it stores the number of CDD files in
    the ranked list that hit a particular coverage point.
    </para>
    <para>
    The specified CDD files are ranked in a series of steps, some of which are reiterated for each CDD that is
    selected to be ranked. Here is the basic algorithm (in pseudo-code):
    </para>
    <para>

        set unique_found to true
      }
      if our score > highest score and a "unique" coverage point was found {
        set highest_score to our score
