 $Log$
 Revision 1.35  2008/09/08 22:15:17  phase1geo
 Regression updates and modifications for new FSM GUI output (this isn't complete
 at this time).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.34  2008/09/06 05:59:45  phase1geo
 Adding assertion exclusion reason support and have most code implemented for
 FSM exclusion reason support (still working on debugging this code).  I believe
 that assertions, FSMs and lines might suffer from the same problem...
 Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.33  2008/08/29 05:38:37  phase1geo
 Adding initial pass of FSM exclusion ID output.  Need to fix issues with the -e
 option usage for all metrics, I believe (certainly for FSM).  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.32  2008/08/18 23:07:26  phase1geo
 Integrating changes from development release branch to main development trunk.
 Regression passes.  Still need to update documentation directories and verify
 that the GUI stuff works properly.

 Revision 1.29.2.4  2008/08/07 20:51:04  phase1geo
 Fixing memory allocation/deallocation issues with GUI.  Also fixing some issues with FSM
 table output and exclusion.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.29.2.3  2008/08/07 06:39:10  phase1geo
 Adding "Excluded" column to the summary listbox.

 Revision 1.29.2.2  2008/08/06 20:11:33  phase1geo
 Adding support for instance-based coverage reporting in GUI.  Everything seems to be
 working except for proper exclusion handling.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.29.2.1  2008/07/10 22:43:50  phase1geo
 Merging in rank-devel-branch into this branch.  Added -f options for all commands
 to allow files containing command-line arguments to be added.  A few error diagnostics
 are currently failing due to changes in the rank branch that never got fixed in that
 branch.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.30  2008/06/27 14:02:00  phase1geo
 Fixing splint and -Wextra warnings.  Also fixing comment formatting.

 Revision 1.29  2008/05/30 05:38:30  phase1geo
 Updating development tree with development branch.  Also attempting to fix
 bug 1965927.

 Revision 1.28.2.1  2008/05/08 23:12:42  phase1geo
 Fixing several bugs and reworking code in arc to get FSM diagnostics
 to pass.  Checkpointing.

 Revision 1.28  2008/04/15 06:08:46  phase1geo
 First attempt to get both instance and module coverage calculatable for
 GUI purposes.  This is not quite complete at the moment though it does
 compile.

 Revision 1.27  2008/02/09 19:32:44  phase1geo
 Completed first round of modifications for using exception handler.  Regression
 passes with these changes.  Updated regressions per these changes.

 Revision 1.26  2008/02/01 06:37:08  phase1geo
 Fixing bug in genprof.pl.  Added initial code for excluding final blocks and
 using pragma excludes (this code is not fully working yet).  More to be done.

 Revision 1.25  2008/01/16 06:40:35  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.24  2008/01/16 05:01:22  phase1geo
 Switched totals over from float types to int types for splint purposes.

 Revision 1.23  2008/01/07 23:59:54  phase1geo
 More splint updates.

 Revision 1.22  2007/11/20 05:28:58  phase1geo
 Updating e-mail address from trevorw@charter.net to phase1geo@gmail.com.

 Revision 1.21  2007/03/30 22:43:13  phase1geo
 Regression fixes.  Still have a ways to go but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.20  2006/09/20 22:38:09  phase1geo
 Lots of changes to support memories and multi-dimensional arrays.  We still have
 issues with endianness and VCS regressions have not been run, but this is a significant
 amount of work that needs to be checkpointed.

 Revision 1.19  2006/06/29 04:26:02  phase1geo
 More updates for FSM coverage.  We are getting close but are just not to fully
 working order yet.

 Revision 1.18  2006/06/28 22:15:19  phase1geo
 Adding more code to support FSM coverage.  Still a ways to go before this
 is completed.

 Revision 1.17  2006/04/05 15:19:18  phase1geo
 Adding support for FSM coverage output in the GUI.  Started adding components
 for assertion coverage to GUI and report functions though there is no functional
 support for this at this time.

 Revision 1.16  2006/03/28 22:28:27  phase1geo
 Updates to user guide and added copyright information to each source file in the
 src directory.  Added test directory in user documentation directory containing the
 example used in line, toggle, combinational logic and FSM descriptions.

 Revision 1.15  2006/01/24 23:24:37  phase1geo
 More updates to handle static functions properly.  I have redone quite a bit
 of code here which has regressions pretty broke at the moment.  More work
 to do but I'm checkpointing.

 Revision 1.14  2005/11/08 23:12:09  phase1geo
 Fixes for function/task additions.  Still a lot of testing on these structures;
 however, regressions now pass again so we are checkpointing here.

 Revision 1.13  2004/04/05 12:30:52  phase1geo
 Adding *db_replace functions to allow a design to be opened with new CDD
 results (for GUI purposes only).

 Revision 1.12  2003/11/07 05:18:40  phase1geo
 Adding working code for inline FSM attribute handling.  Full regression fails
 at this point but the code seems to be working correctly.

 Revision 1.11  2003/10/13 12:27:25  phase1geo
 More fixes to FSM stuff.

 Revision 1.10  2003/10/10 20:52:07  phase1geo
 Initial submission of FSM expression allowance code.  We are still not quite
 there yet, but we are getting close.

 Revision 1.9  2003/09/22 03:46:24  phase1geo
 Adding support for single state variable FSMs.  Allow two different ways to
 specify FSMs on command-line.  Added diagnostics to verify new functionality.

 Revision 1.8  2003/09/12 04:47:00  phase1geo
 More fixes for new FSM arc transition protocol.  Everything seems to work now
 except that state hits are not being counted correctly.

 Revision 1.7  2003/08/25 13:02:03  phase1geo
 Initial stab at adding FSM support.  Contains summary reporting capability
 at this point and roughly works.  Updated regress suite as a result of these
 changes.

 Revision 1.6  2002/11/05 00:20:07  phase1geo
 Adding development documentation.  Fixing problem with combinational logic
 output in report command and updating full regression.

 Revision 1.5  2002/10/31 23:13:50  phase1geo
 Fixing C compatibility problems with cc and gcc.  Found a few possible problems
 with 64-bit vs. 32-bit compilation of the tool.  Fixed bug in parser that
 lead to bus errors.  Ran full regression in 64-bit mode without error.

 Revision 1.4  2002/10/29 19:57:50  phase1geo
 Fixing problems with beginning block comments within comments which are
 produced automatically by CVS.  Should fix warning messages from compiler.

 Revision 1.3  2002/09/13 05:12:25  phase1geo
 Adding final touches to -d option to report.  Adding documentation and
 updating development documentation to stay in sync.

 Revision 1.2  2002/07/03 03:31:11  phase1geo
 Adding RCS Log strings in files that were missing them so that file version
 information is contained in every source and header file.  Reordering src
 Makefile to be alphabetical.  Adding mult1.v diagnostic to regression suite.
