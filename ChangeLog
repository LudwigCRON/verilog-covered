2007-03-09 11:37  phase1geo

	Fixing a couple of GUI bugs.  First, the preprocessor was emitting
	incorrect information for GUI purposes.  Now, included files are
	not output by the preprocessor when readying information for GUI
	display.  Also fixed bug pertaining to line exclusion/inclusion --
	when multiple root expressions existed on the same line, the line
	summary information in the GUI was being incremented/decremented by
	that amount instead of incrementing/decrementing by one.
