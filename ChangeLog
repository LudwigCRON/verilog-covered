2009-05-27 01:44  phase1geo

	Fixing issue with unassigned variable that caused intermittent
	failures.  Added mem6.1 diagnostic to verify that memory accesses
	on LHS of non-blocking statements that are not assigned are not
	assigned via non-blocking assignments.	IV and Cver regressions
	fully pass.

2009-05-27 01:44  phase1geo

	file mem6.1.rptI was initially added on branch stable-0_7-branch.

2009-05-27 01:44  phase1geo

2009-05-26 18:17  phase1geo

	Completed implementation of non-blocking assignment code.  Still
	need to do more testing though early testing looks good except for
	VPI mode.  Checkpointing.

2009-05-26 08:10  phase1geo

	Starting to lay the groundwork for adding non-blocking assignment
	support.  This work is incomplete at this point.  Checkpointing.

	Updating ChangeLog.

2009-05-24 21:28  phase1geo

	Adding support for === and !== operators in "goto expr" command.

2009-05-24 00:19  phase1geo

	Adding current simulation time to debug output.

2009-05-23 23:21  phase1geo

	Fixing issues with goto line when filename:line is specified.  Also
	changing debug command to supply three values:	off, less and more.
	 The more option is equivalent to the old 'on' option, while the
	new 'less' option outputs all statements executed (not just the
	last).

2009-05-23 22:43  phase1geo

	Adding support for Ctrl-C processing when -cli score option is
	specified.  This handles the last CLI support request at the
	moment.

2009-05-23 22:07  phase1geo

	Adding support to goto a line.	Changing goto command to support
	time, line and expression.  This takes care of another support
	request to enhance the CLI.

2009-05-23 15:53  phase1geo

	Adding support for a CLI find command which simulates until a given
	expression is true.  Limited testing has been performed.

2009-05-23 08:43  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix bug 2795215.	No status bar is drawn if we are in
	debug mode.

2009-05-23 08:37  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 2795209.

2009-05-23 08:21  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix bug 2795640.	IV and Cver regressions pass with
	this change, but running under VCS will be required to verify that
	the bug fix is complete.

2009-05-23 08:07  phase1geo

	Moving code to display current debug mode to display regardless of
	the current debug mode.
