	* src/cli.c: Fixing issues with goto line when filename:line is
	specified.  Also changing debug command to supply three values: 
	off, less and more.  The more option is equivalent to the old 'on'
	option, while the new 'less' option outputs all statements executed
	(not just the last).

2009-05-23 22:43  phase1geo

	* src/: cli.c, cli.h, sim.c: Adding support for Ctrl-C processing
