	Fixing bug with empty named begin-end block.  This was causing a
	syntax error message to be output and/or other internal errors. 
	Added named_block2 diagnostic to regression suite to verify that
	Covered handles this case correctly.  Full regression passes.  Also
	fixed a small bug in the db_read function that would cause Covered
	to flag an internal assertion error if an error occurred while
	reading the CDD file and the -D option was specified.
