	* ChangeLog (1.71.2.3): Updating ChangeLog.

2009-05-24 21:28  phase1geo

	* src/cli.c (1.28.6.11): Adding support for === and !== operators
	in "goto expr" command.

2009-05-24 00:19  phase1geo

	* src/cli.c (1.28.6.10): Adding current simulation time to debug
	output.

2009-05-23 23:21  phase1geo

	* src/cli.c (1.28.6.9): Fixing issues with goto line when
	filename:line is specified.  Also changing debug command to supply
	three values:  off, less and more.  The more option is equivalent
	to the old 'on' option, while the new 'less' option outputs all
	statements executed (not just the last).

2009-05-23 22:43  phase1geo

	* src/: cli.c (1.28.6.8), cli.h (1.7.14.3), sim.c (1.136.4.3):
	Adding support for Ctrl-C processing when -cli score option is
	specified.  This handles the last CLI support request at the
	moment.

2009-05-23 22:07  phase1geo

	* src/: cli.c (1.28.6.7), cli.h (1.7.14.2), sim.c (1.136.4.2):
	Adding support to goto a line.	Changing goto command to support
	time, line and expression.  This takes care of another support
	request to enhance the CLI.

2009-05-23 15:53  phase1geo

	* src/: cli.c (1.28.6.6), vector.h (1.71.4.3): Adding support for a
	CLI find command which simulates until a given expression is true. 
	Limited testing has been performed.

2009-05-23 08:43  phase1geo

	* src/cli.c (1.28.6.5): Attempting to fix bug 2795215.	No status
	bar is drawn if we are in debug mode.

2009-05-23 08:37  phase1geo

	* src/cli.c (1.28.6.4): Fixing bug 2795209.

2009-05-23 08:21  phase1geo

	* src/db.c (1.351.2.8): Attempting to fix bug 2795640.	IV and Cver
	regressions pass with this change, but running under VCS will be
	required to verify that the bug fix is complete.

2009-05-23 08:07  phase1geo

	* src/cli.c (1.28.6.3): Moving code to display current debug mode
	to display regardless of the current debug mode.
