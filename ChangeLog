	Adding mem2 diagnostic to regression suite.

2006-08-26 23:17  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1546059 and also fixes a statement connection problem. 
	Full IV regression passes; however, I am going to attempt to fix
	the bug in a way that is more optimal.

2006-08-22 16:35  phase1geo

	Adding named_block3 diagnostic to verify previous fix.	Also fixed
	GUI function for getting missing line numbers (to match the
	previous fix).	Full regression passes.

2006-08-22 16:17  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1544169.  NB_CALL expressions were somehow being output
	as a an uncovered line in line reporting.

2006-08-21 22:57  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1544325.  Updated regressions.  Full IV regressions now
	pass.

2006-08-21 22:44  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1544322.

2006-08-18 20:41  phase1geo

	Updating documentation for the -B global option.

2006-08-18 12:56  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1542454 and fixing hole in event triggering/detection
	logic that was created when fixing bug 1538920.

2006-08-17 23:50  phase1geo

	First swag at integrating name obfuscation for all output (with the
	exception of CDD output).

2006-08-17 17:41  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1538920, correcting the calculation of the AEDGE
	operator.  Also fixed this calculation when it is examining events
	-- always passes when it is looking at an event (events will
	automatically cause these operators to be evaluated).  Also added
	extra debugging information in the sim.c file to aid in tracking
	down simulation problems.  Updated full regression which now passes
	with these changes.

2006-08-17 16:03  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1541944 by checking to make sure that any command-line
	option that requires a value has that value specified.

2006-08-13 22:52  phase1geo

	Attempting to fix bug 1538920.	Updating regressions for change. 
	Icarus Verilog regression passes.

2006-08-13 20:58  phase1geo

	Updating documentation for -rI option.

2006-08-13 20:56  phase1geo

	Adding -rI option to allow the user to completely skip the race
	condition checking phase of scoring.

2006-08-11 17:32  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1538922.  Adding missing slist3.2.cdd file.

2006-08-10 23:23  phase1geo

	Adding slist3.3 diagnostic to verify last checkin fix.

2006-08-10 23:13  phase1geo

	Fixing another issue related to bug 1535412 dealing with implicit
	event expressions and embedded memories.  I have altered the way
	that memories (and other unsupported variable types) are handled
	internally in Covered.	The names are no longer prefixed with an
	'!' character but rather have the "not_handled" vsignal attribute
	set.  Full Icarus Verilog regression passes.

2006-08-10 17:22  phase1geo

	Fixing memory leak issue with the latest checkin.

2006-08-10 15:27  phase1geo

	Fixing issue with an implicitly created signal caused from binding
	an implicit event expression to a signal in a lower-level
	hierarchy.  Added slist3.2 diagnostic to verify the appropriate
	behavior.  Also updated the scoping function to match the
	development branch.  Full regression passes.

2006-08-09 22:15  phase1geo

	Fixing two bugs submitted to database to fix segmentation fault and
	memory leakage issue.

2006-08-09 16:54  phase1geo

	Some updates to ready files for 0.4.7 stable release.

2006-08-09 16:52  phase1geo

	Fixing bug 1535412.  Implicit sensitivity blocks now correctly
	traverse named begin/end blocks and fork/join blocks.  Added new
	diangostics to verify this fix.  Full regression passes.
